# Kira-Proxy

Hi! I'm Kira, a beginner in coding, and this is my first project â€” a proxy-cheat for Minecraft Bedrock Edition based on [gophertunnel](https://github.com/sandertv/gophertunnel). The code might not be perfect since I'm still learning, but I hope youâ€™ll find it fun to try! 

## Disclaimer
**This is a cheat proxy for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. It was tested on Russian-speaking servers and some others, mostly running PocketMine-MP or its forks. Using it may break server rules and get you banned. Iâ€™m not responsible for any consequences â€” use it at your own risk!**

## Features and Commands
Hereâ€™s what `Kira-Proxy` can do with its commands (type them in the game chat). Some features might not work perfectly yet â€” please let me know if you find bugs so I can fix them!

### Notes
- **Radar**: Temporarily not supported, but Iâ€™m working on fixing it soon!
- Some features might not work properly on all servers (especially non-PocketMine ones). If something breaks, please tell me so I can improve it!

## How to Use
1. Set up the proxy (see Installation below).
2. Copy the code from `kira.go` in this repo into a new file called `kira.go` inside your `gophertunnel` folder.
3. Edit `config.toml` to connect to your server.
4. Run the proxy with `go run kira.go`.
5. Open Minecraft Bedrock and connect to `localhost:19132` (or the `LocalAddress` from `config.toml`).
6. Type commands in chat starting with `.` (like `.tp 100 64 200`).
7. Have fun, but be careful â€” servers might not like cheats!

## Installation

### Termux (Android)
1. **Install Termux**:
   - Get it from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) (Google Play version wonâ€™t work).

2. **Install Go**:
   - Update Termux:
     ```
     pkg update && pkg upgrade
     ```
   - Install Go:
     ```
     pkg install golang
     ```
   - Check: `go version`.

3. **Download gophertunnel**:
   - Install `git`:
     ```
     pkg install git
     ```
   - Download:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/sandertv/gophertunnel
     cd gophertunnel
     ```

4. **Add Kira-Proxy**:
   - Download `kira.go` from this repo:
     ```
     create a kira file.go : nano kira.go , then copy the code from Main.go to this repository and paste it into your file
     ```

5. **Set Up Config**:
   - Edit `config.toml` with `nano`:
     ```
     nano config.toml
     ```
   - Change `RemoteAddress` to your server (e.g., `play.nethergames.org:19132`).
   - Save (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

6. **Run It**:
   - Start the proxy:
     ```
     go run kira.go
     ```

## Configuration
Edit `config.toml` in the `gophertunnel` folder to change where the proxy listens and connects:
```toml
[Connection]
LocalAddress = "0.0.0.0:19132"      # Where you connect in Minecraft
RemoteAddress = "play.nethergames.org:19132"  # The server youâ€™re playing on
```

## Feedback
Since Iâ€™m new to coding, Iâ€™d love to hear what you think! If something doesnâ€™t work or you have ideas, please let me know by opening an issue here on GitHub. Thanks for trying my proxy! ðŸ’œ
